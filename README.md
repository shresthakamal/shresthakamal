My name is Kamal Shrestha, Data and AI enthusiast.

I am a 2nd year MTech. student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at [Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad (IITH)](iith.ac.in) working under the supervision of [Dr. Maunendra Sankar Desarkar](https://people.iith.ac.in/maunendra/index.html).

**Research Interests:**

My primary research focuses on conditional language generation for open-domain dialogue systems (chit-chat) using external knowledge integration with the long-term goal of instilling human-like communication, common sense knowledge, and reasoning capabilities in machines.

Currently, I am also working to develop a heuristic based recommendation engine for a jobs recommendation platform that is aimed at providing odd jobs to differently abeled people. The core methodology includes proper user and job profilling for appropriate recommendation.
